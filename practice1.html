                People with disabilities face a variety of challenges. They must deal with many issues
                and obstacles in order to perform their daily lives properly. However, quick technological
                advancements have aided those with disabilities as well. By utilizing computing systems for
                skills such as reading, writing, communication, walking, and many others, technology is assisting
                in the reduction of barriers. Technology has given disabled people the ability to conduct a wide
                range of daily activities independently, but they still face a number of challenges when it comes
                to computer use.
